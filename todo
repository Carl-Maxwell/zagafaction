* the frontier memoization is really lazy, could miss updating nodes that need updating
* for large node counts generation takes way too long. Probably the collision detection code.
  * is the pythagorean theorem the reason it's so expensive? Could probably approximate it more cheaply
  * can probably cache collisions too, once a node is created it is never deleted or moved.
* remove polygon, except in generator
* fix rotator so that if the rotation goes over/under 0/360 it wraps, keep it positive
* the name 'angle' is used for too many disparate things, split them up with words like rotation, orientation, etc.
* currently there's no collision detection for edges hitting each other
  * this doesn't _seem_ to actually come up though
* improve command line interface
