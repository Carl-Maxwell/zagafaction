* the BSP code uses recursive function calls, should probably switch to loops
* there are a lot of edge cases for the bsp that I haven't accounted for
  * like nodes overlapping the midpoint line
* change up the color scheme for something more pleasing
* the angle frequencies show a clear trend towards the multiples of 90 degrees
  * maybe they have a lower chance of collisions?
  * I think there's just something wrong with how I eliminate potential connections
* for large node counts generation takes way too long. Probably the collision detection code.
  * is the pythagorean theorem the reason it's so expensive? Could probably approximate it more cheaply
  * the frontier memoization is really lazy, could miss updating nodes that need updating
* remove polygon, except in generator
* fix rotator so that if the rotation goes over/under 0/360 it wraps, keep it positive
* the name 'angle' is used for too many disparate things, split them up with words like rotation, orientation, etc.
* currently there's no collision detection for edges hitting each other
  * this doesn't _seem_ to actually come up though
* improve command line interface
